# Evolutionary Algorithm

It is an own implementation of classic genetic algorithm and distributed island-model genetic algorithm. Everything was implemented in R. Also performance reports with comparison of both algorithms are included. 

More information can be found in documentation in Polish.

## Purpose

This project was developed during one of my courses at the University. It was a group project and it got me a base understanding of evolutionary algorithms and R programming language.

## Licence

This project is under the MIT License.
